Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, they classified it differently:

VGG: labrador retriever
ResNet: golden retriever
AlexNet: german shepherd


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes! All three models classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed of dog, indicating they were robust to the horizontal flip transformation.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as "not a dog".

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I would select ResNet as the best performing model on these uploaded images. While all models correctly classified the non-dog images and were robust to the horizontal flip for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg, ResNet correctly identified the breed of Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever, whereas the other models misclassified it. This indicates ResNet had the highest accuracy on classifying the dog breed in the uploaded images.
